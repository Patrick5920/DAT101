      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
When wake-up time is NOT 7 (e.g., 6 or 8):

The condition wakeUpTime == 7 is false

Nothing happens (no message is printed)

When wake-up time IS exactly 7:

The condition is true

The message about catching the bus is printed
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
 When wake-up time is NOT 7 (e.g., 6 or 8):

The if condition is false

The else block runs

Message about taking the car is printed

When wake-up time IS exactly 7:

The if condition is true

Message about taking the bus is printed
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
     When wake-up time is less than 7 (e.g., 6):

Neither condition matches

The else case runs → take the car

When wake-up time is greater than 8 (e.g., 9):

Again, neither condition matches

The else case runs → take the car

When wake-up time is exactly 7:

First condition is true → bus

When wake-up time is exactly 8:

Second condition is true → train
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
    </ol>
If the number is greater than 0:

Output: "Positive"

If the number is less than 0:

Output: "Negative"

If the number is exactly 0:

It is neither positive nor negative

If your code only checks > 0 and < 0, nothing prints

Zero must be handled with a separate condition if needed
