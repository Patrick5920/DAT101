 <li>1. Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>

<p>Object-oriented development (OOD) is important because it helps programmers organize, structure, and scale their code more effectively. By modeling software around real-world entities (objects), OOD makes programs easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

Key benefits include:

Reusability, Classes and objects can be reused across different parts of an application.

Maintainability, Changes can be made in one place without breaking the entire system.</p>

 <li>2. In Task 1, we create a static object called AccountType. Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>

<p>The AccountType object is used as a centralized collection of constant values representing different account types (e.g., Brukskonto, Sparekonto, etc.).

This type of object helps software development by:

Preventing hard-coded strings scattered throughout the code

Reducing typos and inconsistencies

Making updates easier (change the value in one place)

Improving code clarity and meaning

In practice, it works like an enumeration (enum), giving us a reliable set of predefined options.</p>

 <li>3. Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>

<p>Encapsulation is used to protect internal data and logic inside a class so that it cannot be accessed or modified incorrectly from outside the object.

We “hide” code to:

Prevent accidental misuse of data

Enforce rules and validation

Reduce dependencies between parts of the program

Make code easier to debug and maintain

In JavaScript constructor functions:

Public members are created using this.propertyName

Private members are created using variables declared with let, const, or var inside the constructor (not attached to this)

Public methods can access private members through closures, but private members cannot be accessed directly from outside the object.</p>

 <li>4. Explain what happens when we use the new command in JavaScript.</li>

<p>When we use the new keyword in JavaScript, the following steps occur:

A new empty object is created

The constructor function is called

this inside the constructor refers to the new object

Properties and methods are attached to the object via this

The new object is returned automatically

basically new creates a new instance of a class or constructor function, allowing multiple objects to be created from the same blueprint.</p>
