1. What is an array?

An array is a data structure that stores multiple values in a single variable, where each value has an index.

2. What does it mean to “hardcode” in programming?

Hardcoding means writing fixed values directly into the code instead of making them configurable or dynamic.

Example:

Hardcoded: "Monday" written directly in many places

Better: store "Monday" once in a variable or object and reuse it

Hardcoding makes programs harder to maintain and update.

3. Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse the array when we don’t know its length.

In task 3:

A text string is created. The string is split into an array where each word becomes one element.

A loop is used to go through the array.

For each element, we print:

the word number, the index, the word itself. When we don’t know the array length, we use the array’s .length property in a loop. This allows the loop to automatically stop at the last element, no matter how many elements the array contains.

4. Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?

Storing class instances in arrays allows us to:

Handle many objects of the same type efficiently

Use loops to perform actions on all objects

Add, remove, search, or sort objects easily

Keep code clean, scalable, and organized

This is especially useful when working with collections like books, users, or products.

5. Explain the EWeekDays object from task 7.

The EWeekDays object works like an enumeration combined with bit flags.

Each weekday has a unique numeric value (powers of two)

The value attribute allows multiple days to be combined using addition

The name attribute stores a readable description

Differences:

WeekDay1–WeekDay7
Represent individual days (one value each)

Workdays
A combination of Monday–Friday using added values

Weekends
A combination of Saturday and Sunday

This setup allows us to
Combine days, Check if a specific day is included
Store multiple days in a single number


6. Explain how a “callback” routine works when sorting.

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and executed by it.

When using .sort(callback):
JavaScript repeatedly calls the callback
The callback compares two elements at a time

It returns:
a negative number → first element comes first. zero → no change
a positive number → second element comes first

7. What happens in the sorting routines you created?

During sorting:

The array takes two elements at a time
The callback compares them
Based on the returned value, the array decides:
swap them or keep their order

If we print both parameters inside the callback, we can see exactly which values are being compared, helping us understand how the sorting algorithm rearranges the array step by step.

8. In task 10, what does the first element of the array contain?

The first element of the array contains another array, representing the first row.

Each element inside that row array represents a column cell, usually containing text that describes its row and column position.
